Use the `oscar_nominees` table in Mode to complete the following 12 questions.

#Question 1

Task 1: Order from smallest id to largest.


SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.oscar_nominees 
  WHERE year < 1990
  ORDER BY id ASC
  LIMIT 30;

  /*I had to add a limit in order for the id column to appear. Without a limit, it would be left off.*/

#Question 2
What movies were made from 2000 to today?

Task 1: Show the oldest movie in your first row.

SELECT 
    movie, 
    year,

  FROM tutorial.oscar_nominees 
  WHERE id >= 50
  ORDER BY year ASC
  LIMIT 21;

  /*It says "Restrict the number of rows in your output to 20 after id: 50." This suggests to me that they wanted to include 50, then add 20 addtl. rows (hence a total count of 21)*/

Task 2: Order from oldest movie to youngest.

I could have sorted based on only these two categories, but the way the question is worded suggests to me that we should ALSO include nominees from other categories because they did not technically win either by definition.*/
